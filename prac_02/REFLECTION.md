## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

55%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Mostly at home

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

The habit of committing in every milestone and add docstring for every function is a good start, I think I can keep going on.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I still like to tighten the amount of time to study, for example focus this subject only on Friday or Saturday.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I am a slow thinker and learner, most of the time I cannot catch up what lecturer said. Only self learning is comfortable for me.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

The instructions and guides for practical are very clear.
